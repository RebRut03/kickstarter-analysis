# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

 - ### The purpose of this project is to analyze crowdfunding campaign data for an emerging playwright Louise. The goal of  this project is for Louise to gain a better understanding of different campaignsâ€™ success rates in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals in order for her to make an informed decision on her next steps.  In this report, I will focus on how successful theater campaigns were based on their launch dates, and I will also compare how play campaigns fared based on their associated funding goals.

 - ### Outcomes Based on Goals - Play Projects
   -   It appears that the lower monetary goals between Play campaigns with a goal of less than $1,000 were 75% successful.  Play campaigns with a goal between $1000 and $4,999    were 72% successful.  Also, of note,
