# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

- ### Purpose - The purpose of this project is to analyze crowdfunding campaign data for an emerging playwright Louise. The goal of  this project is for Louise to gain a better understanding of different campaignsâ€™ success rates in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals in order for her to make an informed decision on her next steps.  Specifically, for this portion of the project, I will compare how successful theater campaigns were based on their launch dates, and I will also compare how play campaigns faired based on their associated funding goals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. It is recommended to launch theater campaigns in May and June because these are the highest success rates at 67% and 65% respectively. 
  2. December 47% shows to be the highest failure rate followed closely by October 43% so it is not suggested to launch campaigns in those months.  
  3. The cancellations are relatively low comparatively speaking, but the highest cancellation month is January at 7%.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
