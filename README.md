## **Overview of Project**

### Purpose 
- The purpose of this project is to analyze crowdfunding campaign data for an emerging playwright Louise. The goal of  this project is for Louise to gain a better understanding of different campaignsâ€™ success rates in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals in order for her to make an informed decision on her next steps.  Specifically, for this portion of the project, I will compare how successful theater campaigns were based on their launch dates, and I will also compare how play campaigns faired based on their associated funding goals.
