# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

 - ### Project Purpose
   - The purpose of this project is to analyze kickstarter campaign data for an emerging playwright Louise. The goal of  this project is for Louise to gain a better understanding of different campaignsâ€™ success rates in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals in order for her to make an informed decision on her next steps. 
   - In this report, I will focus on how successful theater campaigns were based on their launch dates, and I will also compare how play campaigns fared based on their associated funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

 - ### Analysis of Theater Campaign Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   -  The line chart titled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" below illustrates how successful theater campaings were based on their launch date.
   -  This chart was created by converting the kickstarter campaign data into a pivot table and includes data from 2010 to 2017.  The `Year()` function was utilized to convert the Date Created Conversion column in the kickstarter data to a year column.  
   -  On the x axis you'll notice, the years are grouped by month.  This was accomplished by grouping the dates in the pivot table by month and represents the campains' launch month.. 
   -  The y axis shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campains.

 - ### Analysis of Play Campaign Outcomes Based on Goals
   - The line chart titled "Outcomes Based on Goals" below illustrates how successful play projects were compared to differnt levels of funding goals.
   - This chart was created by converting the kickstarter campaign data into a pivot table.  The `COUNTIFS()` function was used to populate the number of successful, failed and canceled play projects.  The `SUMS()` function was used to come up with a total of the play projects based on the numbers returned by the `COUNTIFS()`.  A percentage was calculated based on the number of succesful, failed and canceled divided by the total projects per funding level. 
   -  The x axis shows the differnt funding goal levels utilized for the sake of this analysis.  
   -  The y axis shows the percentage successful, failed, and canceled play projects based on the goal funding levels.

 - ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   - Being unfamiliar with `COUNTIFS` statements presented a challenge during the course of this analysis. Specifically, I struggled with how to input the higher end of the range.  
     - For example, when trying to calculate, the number of successful, failed and canceled play projects, i initially input `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D, ">=1000" AND "<=4999" ,Kickstarter!$F:$F, "successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R, "plays")` thinking it would work to use an `AND` function to combine the lower and higher end of the funding range, but I received an error.  
     - Utimatley, I used the following formula and received the apprporiate calculation `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D, ">=1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F, "successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R, "plays", Kickstarter!$D:$D, "<=4999")`.
   - Also, if someone doing this was unaware of the `YEAR()` and the abiality to group by months in the pivot table for Theater outcomes vs the launch date, that could create issues coming up with the final anlaysis goal of the first exercise.


## Results

 - ### Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Theater Campains
   - It is recommended to launch theater campaigns in May and June because these months show to be the highest success rates.
    - May - 111 successful campaigns out of 166 total campains or 67% 
    - June - 100 successful campaigns out of 153 total campaigns or 65%. 
   - 47% of theater campaigns launched in December failed, followed closely by 43% in October, so it is not suggested to launch campaigns in these months.  
   - The cancellations are relatively low comparatively speaking, but the highest cancellation month is January at 7%.
  
 - ### Outcomes Based on Goals - Play Projects
  - It appears that the lower monetary goals between Play campaigns with a goal of less than $1,000 were 75% successful.  Play campaigns with a goal between $1000 and $4,999    were 72% successful.  Also, of note,

 - ### Limitations in Dataset
  - The plays on goal campaign und85% of the data was for campaigns under 10k.  There is less data from the higher spend campaigns which make make it hard to use this as a realiable sample of the poplution.  Only 14% of the data was for above 10k.  

 - ### Additional Suggested Tables or Graphs
  - Compaire funding pledged or raised to get a full picture. For example
  - Outliers box and whisker
